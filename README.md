Hello Friends! 🌟 Welcome to my corner of the internet. My name is Muhamad Farrel Rizqullah, hailing from Sidoarjo. Currently, I'm pursuing my passion for technology as a student majoring in information technology at Politeknik Negeri Malang. With a fervent love for frontend web development, I craft digital experiences that captivate and inspire. Let's embark on this journey together and build something extraordinary! ✨
